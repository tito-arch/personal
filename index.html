            <p>
              I'm not a school person, actually, I hate school. I thought that
              attending some good school would bring me closer to the
              people I wanted to be like. I was wrong. I wanted to meet people
              who were passionate about what they were doing and finally find my
              clan.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still passed and got to understand and write a couple of
              algorithms and some physics of how computers actually work
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-col mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">Passion for Innovation</h2>
            <p>
              I want to spend the rest of my life building companies doing deep
              work that is hard to replicate, innovating, and making people's
              lives easy. In my journey, I've learned that overlooking what
              other companies have done thinking that your solution is the best
              is a mistake. I believe in continuous learning and collaboration.
              Now, I aim to meet other like-minded people and build solutions
              that scale horizontally.

              Foundational software for tomorrow built today
            </h2>
            <p>
              Currently, I work at an AI startup, I never believed in AI but then
              came Generative Ai. We'll keep other projects private for now, we
              are not building in public until some point in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mark my words, we are building household companies the future
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still trying my best to work on complex algorithms and not write
              garbage code.

            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              I might as well write a lot of unnecessary stuff here like how my
              health went south. I'll say this though, when you are healthy you
              can make decisions that are not based on fear. I'm not there yet
              but I'm working on it. Been to many schools at least more than six,
              honestly, they just tried to get one that I would fit in. See Yah!
            </p>
            <p>I love roasting people btw. Thanks for passing by, I love you</p>
