        <p>
          I'm not a school person, actually I hate school. I thought that 
          attending some good school would bring me closer to the people I
          wanted to be like. I was wrong. I wanted to meet people who were
          passionate about what they were doing and finally find my clan.
          I was 18 and dumb, I've learnt so much since. 
          The level I was at 18 versus 22 is so vast, it is impossible to possibly put those two things together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still passed btw and got to understand a couple of algorithms and
          some physics of how computers actually work.

        <p>
          I want to spend the rest of my life building companies doing deep work
          that is hard to replicate, innovating, and making people's lives easy.
          In my journey, I've learned that overlooking what other companies have
          done thinking that your solution is the best is a mistake. I believe
          in continuous learning and collaboration. Now, I aim to meet other
          like-minded people and build solutions that scale horizontally.

        <p>
          Currently, I work at an AI start-up. I never believed in AI, but then
          came Generative AI. We'll keep other projects private for now, we are
          not building in public until some point in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark my words, we are building the household companies the future
          needs.

          Still trying my best to work on complex algorithms and not write
          garbage code.

        <p>
          I might as well write a lot of unnecessary stuff here. Been to many
          schools at least more than six, honestly, they just tried to get one
          that I would fit in. See Yah!

        <p>I love roasting people btw. Thanks for passing by, I love you.</p>
